# Vibecoders and Spec-Coders Cheat Sheets

This directory contains practical cheat sheets and quick reference guides for both vibecoders (who prefer intuitive, exploratory development) and spec-coders (who prefer structured, specification-driven development).

The resources here are designed to bridge the gap between different coding styles and provide useful tools for developers regardless of their preferred approach.
